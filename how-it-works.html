                <h3>Planning with the End in Mind</h3>
                <p>I am Sandra Smith, and I am a boutique photographer, not like any other photographer.</p>
                <p>At Sandra Smith Photography, I begin with the end in mind. I start with the planning, working with
                    you, helping you to show you where and how these beautiful images will hang in your home or the
                    story you want to tell in your family album.</p>
                <p>No matter the wall, wide or tall, let's create an amazing iconic image to hang in its place.</p>
                <p>No wall space? Telling your family's story in a luxurious, custom-designed album lets you capture and
                    preserve all the stages of your children's lives. Your unique needs and concerns will guide your
                    one-on-one Design Consultion.</p>

                    Planning & Design Consultation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Your Design Consultation kicks off the Sandra Smith Photography Boutique Process. You and I will
                    meet
                    and during this time I am learning about you and your family. We want the scoop on your family and
                    kids. What are their personalities like? Who's the dialed-in kid, who's the rebel? Understanding
                    your family dynamics allows us to capture their personalities and their relationships as they really
                    are.</p>
                <p>Your every question will be answered, including:</p>
                <p>What types of clothing photograph best?</p>
                <p>A full understanding of the investment you'll be making?</p>
                <p>What are the most suitable areas of your home for your family portraits?</p>
                <p>And other burning questions such as whether or not to bring the family pet (the answer is, “yes!”)

                <p>You’ll leave your Design Consultation with a good idea of what everyone should wear.</p>
                <p>Between then and your Photo Shoot, we are available to consult about your outfits via phone, email, or zoom meeting.</p> 
                <p> Together, we will finalize outfits at least one week prior to your shoot to allow plenty of time for last minute changes.</p>

                <p>
                    Approximately one to two weeks after your photo session, you will attend the View and Order
                    appointment. Your View and Order appointment is the time set aside to finalize your wall portrait
                    order, so be sure and schedule a time when both mom and dad can be there.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Using our state-of-the-art software and images of the walls in your home, I will show your portraits
                    scaled onto your walls, which solves the problem of what size to order; not too big, not too small,
                    but
                    just right!
                </p>
                <p>

                    I will guide you every step of the way using your goals from the consultation to achieve your vision
                    for your family portraits.

                <p>
                    The hard work is over. Your portraits adorn the walls of your home. You, your spouse and family
                    enjoy
                    the warmth and love the wall portraits bring as feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    Your family album has pride of place on your coffee table. And your phone has blown up with texts
                    about the faboulousness of your note cards or holiday cards that you sent out.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Sit back and take credit for creating those beautiful humans that are your children and enjoy seeing
                    the people you love on the walls of your home.
