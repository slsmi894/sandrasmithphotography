                <h3>Sandra's Story</h3>
                <div class="col-4">
                    <p>Hi! I am Sandra. Yes, I am a photographer, but that's not who I am, it's what I love to do. Using my God-given talent, years of knowledge and skills in helping you solve an issue -- getting beautiful images of you, your family, your life, and having a wonderful, easy, relaxing and fun time. Who knew a photo session could be fun?  It's because I am that photographer that cares about you, and making sure that we plan out your session, so you know what's going on. And I show you the beauty of you, and capture your personality.</p>
                    <p>I am a Christian, and proud of it. I love God, and so thankful for all that He has blessed me with. My wonderful life, as a wife, mother, friend, and business woman.</p>
                    <p>My life experiences, have given me such an insight into how I approach photography, life, my family, and my business.</p>
                    <p>I also embrace my heritage, because the different cultures have impacted my life. I am originally from Hawaii, born and raised in my youth, then experienced the north, and now living in the south.  My husband and I lived out west for time, but decided Tennessee was home, where our families were. His parents were here, and my parents had made there home here. So we came back home to raise our kids and be a Tennessean. I do love the South as well.  The culture is so genteel and sweet. The area is just so beautiful, as we are not far from the beautiful lakes, nor are we far from the beautiful mountains.</p>
                    <p>I am an optimist, and a dreamer. My dreams are goals. </p>
                    <p>I love to cook, and all things artistic besides photography, like painting. I love traveling, but especially to my "homeland" of Hawaii.  I feel something special when I am there, and I still have family that live there. I love history and to explore this wonderous country of ours. And one day, I will explore the lands over the big pond - Atlantic Ocean. Gardening has been such an impact in my life, that I aslo have a business in kitchen gardening.</p>
                    <p>I truly believe, if you can walk, talk, breath -- and you have dreams ... go do it.  Especially for young gals, young people, I do believe you can do and be anything you want to be. Be happy, and find your dreams, life is too short!</p>
                    <p>With much love, and laughter...  Sandra</p>
