                <p>Mother of 2. Started her career in wedding fine art photography, took a break to be at home with her
                    family. Then realized it was time to do what she is truly passionate about, so Sandra Smith Photography  was created in 2023 specializing in wall art, boutique style.</p>
                <p>"Digitals on a USB are are overwhelming, and sadly nothing gets printed. I am here to
                    service my
                    clients, as I want for you to have art on your walls, art that happens to be your family." </p>
                <p>"I have an image of our family, when the kids were young, and I always enjoyed seeing that wall art
                    through the years and even today."</p>
                <p>Images that make your heart skip a beat every time you pass them in your home. I want you to have
                    images
                    of your family, that remind you of why you decided to do the whole choatic thing called, "Family" in
                    the
                    first place. </p>
                <p>"Images that go beyond just a record of the people in your life, images that capture the essence of
                    your

                <p>
                    When I am not photographing.....
                </p>
                <p>
                    I teach and tutor coding programming language online through major universities in the US and with
                    the UK, as a part-time side-gig. I really enjoy working through the logic and helping students gain
                    an understanding of the concepts. I started with Johns Hopkins University two years ago, and work
                    with varying universities across the nation on a rotation basis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love the beach... who does not? So I am either traveling to Hawaii to visit family once in a
                    while, or making the annual visit to a the Carolina beaches or Florida beaches. Favorites? Love
                    Folly -- it has the old beach vibe feel that I grew up with, and you should eat at Washout for Wed
                    Oyster Roast, and of course, The Lost Dog Cafe. For Florida, love the Santa Rosa/Miramar beaches.
                    But I will say, nothing beats the water and sand beaches of Hawaii....favorite places there? too
                    many to list here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I love to be at home with my husband and two dogs. I am totally into cooking from scratch, but
                    will take the road less traveled with a starter mix... why not, gives me time back to do other
                    things! Gardening is a must for me, during the pandemic, I really got into it and love it! I love
                    flowers, their beauty is just priceless, I really wish they would last all year, they just make me
                    smile. And if you have never grown your own veggies and herbs, the taste is super awesome!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love life, and I am grateful for my family, for the life we have created!
