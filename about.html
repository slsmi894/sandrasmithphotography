                <h3>Sandra's Story</h3>
                <div class="col-4">
                    <p>Who am I? I am Sandra Smith, and I am a boutique photographer, not like any other photographer.
                    </p>
                    <p>Aside from photography, I am a wife, mother and dog owner.</p>
                    <p>I am passionate about the beauty of life, people, the world, art, history, everything.....</p>
                    <p>I have been described as a "dreamer", I call those goals! As a young girl growing up, I was often
                        told, you can't do that, or that's not for you. I am glad that I didnt listen to that or else I
                        would have missed out on a lot of things, especially photography.</p>
                    <p>Here's how photography came about....its quite romantic, in fact. I was always interested in it,
                        I have always been attracted to art. I grew up around it. I took up oil painting lessons at the
                        age of 8, while growing up in Hawaii.</p>
                    <p>I always wanted to study photography, but just didnt know where to look. My local college
                        counselor told me that was not a career and advised me to go into accounting. So, I put this
                        "dream" aside. Then years later, married in and in California, a family member of mine, was a
                        photographer and needed help. </p>
                    <p>So, I volunteered to assist at a wedding, and for me, something was awakened. It was like walking
                        into a storybook. The wedding was held a castle-like venue. The bride was breathless, it was
                        just so magical. I was bitten! I set my sites to learning how to become a photogapher too. I am
                        the youngest in my family of 7, and not always taken seriously. I believe that when someone has
                        a passion that is unresolved, they wonder, and yes, I did different things and just wasnt
                        satisfied. But whatever I did, I did to the best of my ability, my parents instilled a strong
                        work ethic in me.In fact, she went on to become a celebrated photographer, photographing
                        celebrities, winning awards, and teaching photography all over the world. And I was so
                        fortunate, my sister-in-law, the photographer, whom I ended up learning from, is a gifted and
                        talented photographer. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-4">
                    <p>I was hooked, and I too, was gifted with a passion and an eye for photography. While my journey
                        stayed close to home, in Tennessee, through the years, I earned many accolades and awards
                        internationally and locally. I enjoyed the celebration of the wedding day, and loved all the
                        clients I met and many places we traveled to locally and nationally.</p>
                    <p>And after so many years, I decided to take a break to be at home with my family, and my special
                        needs son. My family and I treasure the years we had with him. We will miss him, and we know
                        that we gave him a full life, and he gave us so much, his love.</p>
                    <p>I have been doing photography even while taking a break, its in my dna and I embrace it. And
                        while I specialized in weddings for many years, after taking a break, life with son gave me such
                        a different perspective, on how precious our family is and the time we have together. I now
                        specialize in family and portrait photography, and lifestyle branding photography.</p>
                   
                    <p>The family unit is so important to me, and I want to help you create beautiful images of your
                        family.</p>
                    <p>I tried to leave the world of photography during my break, I went back to finish my degree in
                        Business Management, obtaining my Bachelor's degree, and getting certified in Project
                        Management, earning an extremely high score in my final exam. You have to understand, this was
                        an impossible day, I did not sleep, I was 30 minutes late to the exam, and forgot my reading
                        glasses. After taking the class, I informed the facilitator to reschedule me for the next test.
                        Assuming I didnt pass, she asked why I wanted to do that when I had passed the exam. And then
                        she informed me that I had scored the highest she had seen in years. I cried out of sheer
                        exhaustion, joy and a bit of disbelief.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-4">
                    <p>Also, during covid-19, when we were in lock down, I ventured into two other fields. I signed up
                        for a class in coding, software programming, and wanted to enhance my knowledge, andlearn about
                        gardening. I had learned gardening from my mother when I was young, but wanted to perfect my
                        knowledge and skills. Well, having earned my certification in full stack web development,and I
                        was asked to apply and join the team to teach coding. And I loved it! My first university that I
                        taught at was Johns Hopkins University. I was also invited to join the instructional teams that
                        were teaching coding for United Kingdom/Great Britain. I have enjoyed it these last five years,
                        and now have decided to focus on my true passions, photography and gardening. Crazy right? God
                        has taken me on many journeys, but I always came back to photography or photography kept finding
                        me.</p>
                    <p>I believe in humans, in people of any age. I believe in life, and that we are all capable of
                        doing anything we put our minds to. Nothing is unobtainable, and I especially want to share this
                        message with young girls.</p>
                    <p>So you have learned a little bit about me. I have a big heart for you, and I know that I can help
                        you. Most people are not crazy about how they look in pictures. I will show you that my style is
                        easy, and I know how to capture you to bring forth your gorgeous you, your essence.</p>
                    <p>My thanks, and praise to all who have supported me, but especially to God above. For it is HE who
                        has made me who I am today, and gifted me this wondrous skill of being a gifted photographer.
                    </p>
                    <p>And the gardening.... as mentioned above..where does this come in? Well, that's my other
                        business. Southern Kitchen Garden. People have always asked me if I could help them with their
                        gardening needs, and I love it! And a friend told me, "I think its time you do that as a
                        business!"</p>
                    <!-- <p>My mission is to guide you through the process of capturing the essence of the moment. To help each person that is part of the session to feel secure, beautiful and confident.  Yes, no matter the age, each person needs to feel secure, beautiful and confident. Because each person is beautiful!</p>
                <p>Let me share a story...For my HS Senior Portraits, my Mother won a studio session for me. And I am sorry to say, kindly, not all photographers are photographers. It was the most horrible experience, I was nervous and the photographer could not figure out how to make me feel secure or confident or even beautiful. Pictures were ok, and I swore I would never get my picture made again, ever.</p>
                <p>I beg you, never say never.  I can show you how beautiful you are, and you will feel it and enjoy your session. When I wanted to become a photographer, under the tutiledge of my mentor, I learned what it took to help solve issues like this for my clients. What it is to be a true artist, and to make each person feel secure, beautiful and confident. And of course, with her help, I overcame my fear of getting my picture made again.</p>
                <p>When I became professional, my mission was to help each person feel secure, beautiful and confident. And I have wonderful technique to do just that. Giving a wonderful experience, in fact fun, and a wonderful memory captured through the lens.</p>
                <p>Let's start a conversation about updating your images or your family images! I can help you with that!   </p> -->
