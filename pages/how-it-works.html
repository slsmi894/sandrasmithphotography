                    Planning & Design Consultation
                </h3>
                <p>Your Design Consultation kicks off the Sandra Smith Photography Boutique Process. We want the scoop on your family and kids. What are their personalities like? Who's the dialed-in kid, who's the rebel? Understanding your family dynamics allows us to capture their personalities and their relationships as they really are.</p>
                <p>Your every question will be answered, including:</p>
                <p>What types of clothing photograph best?</p>
                <p>A full understanding of the investment you'll be making?</p>
                <p>What are the most suitable areas of your home for your family portraits?</p>
                <p>And other burning questions such as whether or not to bring the family pet (the answer is, “yes!”)</p>

                <p>You’ll leave your Design Consultation with a good idea of what everyone should wear.</p>
                <p>Between then and your Photo Shoot, we are available to consult about your outfits via phone, email, or zoom meeting.</p> 
                <p> Together, we will finalize outfits at least one week prior to your shoot to allow plenty of time for last minute changes.</p>

                <p>Approximately one week after your photo shoot, you will come to the studio for your View and Order appointment. Your View and Order appointment is the time set aside to finalize your portrait order, so be sure and schedule a time when both mom and dad can be there.

                Using our state-of-the-art software and photos of the walls in your home, we will show your portraits scaled onto your walls, which solves the problem of what size to order; not too big, not too small, but just right!
                
                We will guide you every step of the way using your goals from the consultation to achieve your vision for your family portraits.</p></div>

Your family album has pride of place on your coffee table and your phone has blown up with texts about the fabulousness of your holiday cards. Sit back and take credit for creating those beautiful humans that are your children and enjoy seeing the people you love on the walls of your home. Every. Single. Day.</p>
